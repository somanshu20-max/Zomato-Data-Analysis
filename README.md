- **Online vs Offline Ordering**: Online-order-enabled restaurants tend to receive higher ratings (~4.0) than offline-only restaurants (~3.6), highlighting the impact of digital convenience on customer satisfaction.
- **Order Preferences by Type**:
  - **Dining restaurants** are primarily offline-focused.
  - **Cafés and quick bites** receive a higher proportion of online orders.

**### 📌 Tools & Techniques Used:**
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
